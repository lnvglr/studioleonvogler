What happens when borders shift and identities get buried? This index documents ongoing and historical military occupations, questioning how occupation redraws maps and erases local identities through design.

The project explores shifting national borders—how military occupation redraws lines on maps, often arbitrarily and violently. These border shifts don't just change geography; they bury indigenous and local identities under layers of imposed political structures.

The typographic approach reflects the project's critical stance. Layouts shift and overlap, mirroring how occupations disrupt existing structures. Text treatments vary—dense typography conveys the weight of occupation, while fragmented layouts suggest the fracturing of communities.

The design makes visible how military occupation erases local and indigenous identities through visual techniques: text that fades, overlays that obscure, and layouts that fragment. These strategies mirror how occupation suppresses local culture, language, and identity.
