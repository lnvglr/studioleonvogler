What happens when Korean snack packaging meets Hebrew typography? This typeface emerged from recreating Korean snack designs in Hebrew, translating the bold, playful grotesk quality of hangul into a Hebrew typeface that bridges two typographic traditions.

The design process started by recreating Korean snack packaging designs in Hebrew. Korean packaging features bold, playful typography with a distinctive grotesk quality—boxy structures punctuated by circular elements and large, expressive arches.

Translating these hangul-inspired forms into Hebrew required careful adaptation. Hebrew's right-to-left reading direction and distinct letterforms needed to incorporate the visual DNA of hangul typography while maintaining Hebrew's essential character.

The typeface features a generally boxy structure softened by strategic circular elements and large, sweeping arches. These contrasting elements create a dynamic tension that gives the typeface its distinctive character.
