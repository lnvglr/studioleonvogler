A poster for a concert that never happened. Created in the early days of the COVID pandemic, this design explores Hebrew calligraphy as a primary visual element, bringing expressive, hand-drawn qualities to contemporary poster design.

The poster was created when live events were being canceled across the globe. It exists as a document of that moment—a design created with anticipation but never used. The design explores Hebrew calligraphy rather than standard typography, demonstrating how traditional calligraphic techniques can be integrated into contemporary contexts.


The Hebrew calligraphy employs various techniques: letterforms flow and connect, creating organic shapes that contrast with structured elements. The calligraphy becomes both text and image, functioning as information and decoration.

The use of Hebrew calligraphy for an international event (Polo & Pan / Artbat) creates a cultural dialogue—grounding the event in its local context (Park HaLeumi, Ramat Gan) while the music represents global culture.
