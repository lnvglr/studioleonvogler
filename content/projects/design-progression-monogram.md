description: A detailed design exploration for a monogram consisting of the Hebrew letters alef, zadi, and lamed. The project documents the iterative process of creating a cohesive visual identity from these three distinct letterforms, exploring various approaches to integration, balance, and harmony. The final monogram serves as a testament to the careful consideration of form, space, and cultural context in typographic design.

How do three distinct Hebrew letters—alef (א), zadi (צ), and lamed (ל)—combine into a unified monogram? This exploration tests how letters with different visual weights and structures can interact, overlap, and combine into a cohesive mark.

The three letters bring distinct characteristics: alef has a simple, open structure; zadi features a complex form with a distinctive top stroke; lamed extends vertically with an elegant upward curve. The exploration involved numerous iterations, testing how the letters could be arranged, combined, and refined.


The design progression shows the evolution from initial concepts to refined solutions. Early sketches explore raw combinations and basic relationships. As the process continues, the forms become more integrated, with shared elements and refined proportions.

Creating a monogram from these letters requires balancing different visual weights and spatial requirements while maintaining legibility of each letter and creating a cohesive whole. The final solution represents a balance between individual letterforms and the unified mark.
