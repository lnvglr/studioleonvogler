How do you navigate the complex world of data literacy? This booklet uses a metro map metaphor to transform abstract data concepts into an accessible journey, where each concept becomes a station on interconnected lines.

The central visual concept treats data literacy as a transportation network. Different aspects—data collection, analysis, visualization, interpretation, and ethics—become stations on interconnected lines. Readers can follow specific routes or explore the entire network.

The design employs the visual vocabulary of transit maps: clean lines, color-coded routes, and clear station markers. This familiar language helps readers immediately understand how to navigate the content.

Each "station" represents a key concept or skill, connected by "lines" that show relationships. The "Data Collection" station connects to "Data Analysis," which then connects to "Data Visualization" and "Interpretation."

The metro map metaphor helps learners understand that data literacy isn't linear but a network of interconnected skills. Readers can enter at any point and follow connections to build understanding, much like choosing different routes on a transit system.
