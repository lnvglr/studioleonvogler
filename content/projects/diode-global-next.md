description: A comprehensive multi-script typeface family created through extensive research into typographic hierarchies in Israeli public space. The design explores how different scripts coexist and interact in urban environments, supporting Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Georgian, and N'Ko scripts. The typeface addresses the complex challenges of multilingual typography while maintaining visual coherence and readability across all supported languages.

On Tel Aviv buses, the next stop appears on low-resolution LED displays in Hebrew, Arabic, and English. But something was off: Hebrew text used thick double-pixel strokes while Arabic used thin single-pixel strokes. Hebrew also appeared twice as often in the rotation.

Was this hierarchy a technical necessity—Arabic being too complex for thick strokes on pixel displays—or a design choice? To find out, I designed a bitmap font matching the exact pixel dimensions of these bus displays, testing both single and double-pixel strokes for all three scripts.

The result? Arabic works perfectly with double-pixel strokes. The visual hierarchy wasn't technical—it was a design decision. This project became a multi-script typeface proving that when given equal consideration, Hebrew, Arabic, Latin, and many other scripts can coexist with equal visual weight in public space.
