Why is Arabic text thinner on Tel Aviv bus displays than Hebrew and English? This research project designed a pixel typeface to test whether the hierarchy was technical necessity or design choice—revealing it was the latter.

The investigation explored whether thinner Arabic text was due to technical constraints (Hebrew being compact, Arabic more intricate on low-resolution displays) or arbitrary/political reasons. A pixel typeface was designed for English, Hebrew, and Arabic to fit Tel Aviv bus LED displays.

As it turned out, Arabic could be displayed with the same thickness as Hebrew and English. This revealed the visual hierarchy wasn't a technical necessity but a design choice with significant implications for how languages and communities are represented in public space.

The typeface demonstrates that when designed with equal consideration, all three scripts can coexist with equal visual weight. Multiple languages were later added, making it a truly global multi-script typeface system.
