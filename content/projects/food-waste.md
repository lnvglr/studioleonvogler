Much of the food we throw away is actually worth saving. This zine portrays food savers and gastronomers fighting waste, while its design progresses from chaotic layouts resembling waste to structured clarity—symbolizing transformation.

The zine begins with unstructured, chaotic layouts that visually resemble waste—text fragments, overlapping images, and seemingly random compositions. As the reader progresses, the design gradually becomes more structured and clear, symbolizing how waste can be transformed into something valuable.

The zine portrays people actively fighting to waste less food: food savers who rescue perfectly good produce, and gastronomers who have transformed their kitchens to minimize waste.

The zine is printed on trash bags made of Kraft paper—a material choice that directly connects the publication's form to its content. The rough, utilitarian quality contrasts with the careful design, creating a tension that makes the publication memorable.
